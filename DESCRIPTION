Title: Assorted Header-Only C++ Libraries
Authors@R: person("Aaron", "Lun", role=c("cre", "aut"), email="infinite.monkeys.with.keyboards@gmail.com")
Description:
    Vendors an assortment of useful header-only C++ libraries.
    Bioconductor packages can use these libraries in their own C++ code by LinkingTo this package without introducing any additional dependencies.
    The use of a central repository avoids duplicate vendoring of libraries across multiple R packages,
    and enables better coordination of version updates across cohorts of interdependent C++ libraries.
